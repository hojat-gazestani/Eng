Linking word Grammer
====================
using well need two things
1- know the function
2- Grammer of the linking word or phrase

Three category of linking words
-------------------------------
conjunctions: they need to be used in a sentence with at least two clauses. (because, although)
â€¢ e.g.
    I need to ask for some time off work BECAUSE i am planning to attend a training course
    ALTHOUGH social media can help people to connect with each other, it also has several significant disadvantages.
    
Prepositions: you need to use a noun after the linking word. (due to, despite, because of)
â€¢ e.g.
    DESPITE the well-known benefits of regular exercise, many people still lead a mostly sedentary lifestyle.
    Young professionals are increaingly moving to smaller cities BECAUSE of the high cost of living in large urban centers.
    
Adverbs: Generally used at the begining of a sentence, you need to put a comma afterwards (on the other hand, therfore)
â€¢ e.g.
	Freedom of the press is more important than individuals rights to privacy. THERFORE newspapers should be able to publish stories about the private lives of celebrities if they choose to.
	Of course, elderly people should be paid a pension which reflects the money they paid into the social security system during their working lives. On the other hand, the pension system needs to be sustainable over the long term.
	
Using linking words in your IELTS writing
=========================================
It's much more effective to know a smaller number of linking words or phrases and know how to use them really well.

add information to a topic
--------------------------
furthermore: add a point which is more important than your first idea.
besides: add a point which is often less important than your main idea.

â€¢ e.g.
	Using plastic products generates litter which harms the environment. FURTHERMORE, plastic can take humdreds of years to degrade.
	Smoking has been proven to cause many serious illnesses. Besides, it is an expensive habbit.

Linking words and logic
=======================
You can't connect ideas with linking words.
Linking words don't connect ideas; they highlight a connection which is already there.

On the other hand, one of the major counter argument is that we are living in a cousumer society, where trade war is very common between manufacturing companies and countries. FOR INSTANCE, if a vast amount of information is delivered from the mobile giant Apple, then it could lose not only its leadership but also its huge business in this modern sophistacted world.

For instance: should be used to introduce an example of the preceding point but in this case, the points before and after the linking word are not obviously connected at all.

ðŸ”˜ What you should do?
1- divide linking words according to the idea they express. learn two or three linking words or phrases for each function.
2- Understand the grammer of each linking word; find out what part of speech it is. and how to use it in a sentence.
3- go into more detail. Many words have a similar meaning, but very few have exactly the same meaning.
4- Practise planning and make sure your ideas are well-organised before you start.
